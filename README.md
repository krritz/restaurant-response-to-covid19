# Restaurant Response to COVID-19
In this analysis, I scrape Yelp reviews for 200 restaurants in each of the 25 cities most impacted by COVID-19 (which I define as highest # of deaths instead of highest # of cases due to testing limitations, although this still is likely not the best way to measure this).

The notebook for scraping Yelp can be found [here](yelp-scraping.ipynb).
